When you look back at the biggest breakthroughs in AI over the last decade,
Google has been at the forefront of so many of them. Our groundbreaking work
in foundation models has become the bedrock for the industry and the AI-powered
products that billions of people use daily. As we continue to responsibly advance
these technologies, there’s great potential for transformational uses in areas as
far-reaching as healthcare and human creativity.

Over the past decade of developing AI, we’ve learned that so much is possible as
you scale up neural networks — in fact, we’ve already seen surprising and delightful
capabilities emerge from larger sized models. But we’ve learned through our research
that it’s not as simple as “bigger is better,” and that research creativity is key
to building great models. More recent advances in how we architect and train models
have taught us how to unlock multimodality, the importance of having human feedback
in the loop, and how to build models more efficiently than ever. These are powerful
building blocks as we continue to advance the state of the art in AI while building
models that can bring real benefit to people in their daily lives.
